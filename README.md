## Overview
### Description
The Nightwalker app is a security app that enables users to call 911 emergency line, and communicate your friends and family. It allows security officials and family members to get your location.


### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle & Security
- **Mobile:** Website is interactive and uses a users phone call functionality to contact police and location information.
- **Story:** We want to provide a way for college students around the country to feel safe, even when in unsafe situations.
- **Market:** College Students
- **Habit:** User can immediately call 911 upon opening the app or they can choose to use GPS or ask friends for a walk around campus/the surrounding area. Choosing GPS will allow the user to see their location and send their location to friends.
- **Scope:** The NightWalker will enable users call 911 in case of emergency situations. Users can invite a friend to be a night walker with whom the user shares their current location.
